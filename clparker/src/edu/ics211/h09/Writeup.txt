AI Escargot writeup

While attempting to solve the various test problems thrown at the brute force algorithm I noticed that by comparison to other sudoku problems, the AI Escargot 
problem appeared to be substantially harder than the rest. While only having the given numbers in diagonals or far apart from each other, this forces the brute force 
algorithm to go through more checks and more legal values compared to other sudoku puzzles. With more legal values and more iterations of checking rows, columns, and 3x3s to check 
for repeating numbers, the processing time extends greatly and in turn takes longer for the program to find the working solution.

In my testing, what was considered an easy sudoku problem took between 0.0022 seconds and 0.0030 seconds to solve while a slightly more advanced problem took between 
0.0036 seconds and 0.0058 seconds to solve. While this is roughly a 60% increase in time to complete, the AI Escargot took between 0.0216 at best and 0.0222 at worst in my testing. 
This is roughly a 980% increase in processing time between the easy sudoku and the AI Escargot problem. While both are taking short times to solve by human 
standards this percentage increase of processing time is substantial and definitely stands out to show how much extra time it takes to solve the AI Escargot problem.
