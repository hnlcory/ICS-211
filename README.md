The University of Hawaii, Manoa Course Catalog describes ICS 211 as “Algorithms and their complexity, introduction to software engineering, data structures, searching and sorting algorithms, numerical errors.” This course explores Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and software engineering techniques using Java.

The primary focus of this course is problem solving using Abstract Data Structures in programs.

**Prerequisites:** ICS 111 or instructor’s consent.

Goals
-----

The primary goal of ICS 211: Introduction to Computer Science II is to teach you how to solve problems using standard data structures, including lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees.

A second goal is to advance your Java programming skills. We will be writing a wide variety of Java code this semester.

#### Remember, nothing about ICS 211 makes any sense, except in the light of learning more tools for solving problems with computers
